# Python Project Collection

This repository contains a collection of projects developed in Python. The projects are:

-    Countdown Timer
-    Password Generator
-    ROT-13 Encrypter and Decrypter
-    Mini RSA Encrypter and Decrypter

## Countdown Timer

A simple reverse timer. The Challenge for this project was to not use time.sleep(), but rather to just use the time.time() function to make the timer.

## Password Generator

A password generator that can generate random and secure passwords. This project uses the random module to generate passwords and is a great way to learn how to handle strings in Python.

## ROT-13 Encrypter and Decrypter

A simple ROT-13 encrypter that can encrypt and decrypt messages. This project is a great way to learn about cryptography and the basics of working with strings in Python.

## Mini RSA

A simple implementation of the RSA algorithm. This project is a great way to learn about cryptography and the RSA algorithm.
