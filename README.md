## Countdown Timer

A simple yet powerful timer to keep track of time for various tasks and activities. The project was created using tkinter and is a great starter project for beginners to learn the basics of GUI development. The Challenge for this project was to not use time.sleep(), but rather to just use the time.time() function to make the timer.
